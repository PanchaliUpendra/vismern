                    <p>In the Pre-primary classes, teachers lay a lot of emphasis on the Play-way method. Games are a natural 
                        means of teaching little ones and an integral part of every classroom. Teachers use flash 
                        cards and digital media content to reinforce learning. Songs and rhymes are used to develop 
                        vocabulary.

                    <p>At the Primary level, learning is experiential, fun & activity based. The curriculum is based on the NCERT guidelines and 
                        focuses on laying the foundations of knowledge, skills and attitudes which will guide the young learners for life. The focus is 
                        on conceptual clarity by relating learning to everyday life, developing thinking and analytical skills.
